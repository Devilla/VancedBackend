			"title": "Proƒç Split APKs?",
			"description": "To start off:\n\n1. What are split apks?\nIt's a zip file which contains the base apk, config apk for your device architecture and language apk.\n\nFor example, a typical normal apk has both 32 bit and 64 bit support file, lots of language files and a base apk. So if your device is only 32 bit and you only want english language file, why would you want an extra files which you don't even need and will result in taking huge space in your storage.\n\n**Advantages**:\n‚Ä¢ size of split apk is almost half of normal apk\n‚Ä¢ a split apk only has those files which are relevant for your device and architecture\n\n**Disadvantages:**\nDifficult to newbies or non-technical people\n\n2. Why split?\nGoogle only distributes the YouTube APKs after version 14.54 in split APKs now , so in order to install Vanced, we have to use SAI (Split APK Installer).\nPreviously, they provides normal apk making it easy to install apps on every device.\n\n3. why dev's don't patch apks and make apk from it?\nIt's not like that they can't. It's about increased time in doing this. Converting from apks to apk adds time which they can use that in other ways(both personal and vanced bugs/updates). So please don't ask how to get normal apk. Use old version if you are really lazy or official YT app from play store directly."

			"title": "Why redownload?",
			"description": "The reason is pretty simple: sometimes a downloadeded file can be corrupted, trying to grab them and install will result in an infinite loop of failure. To avoid this, the manager redownloads files every time you press the button.\n\nHowever, the Non-Root installer can now use the already downloaded files to reinstall Vanced."

			"title": "Mikrofon",
			"description": "If you're wondering why there is no microphone permission in the root version of Vanced, that's because the APK used to modify Vanced (minAPI17) is missing the microphone permission. The other APK has it (minAPI21) but that lacks the translation. Why? Ask Google ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nWorkaround: use the non-root variant, or stock YouTube.\n\nNOTE: These issues only exist in version 14 and below. The permissions are now fixed from version 15."
